INSTRUCTIONS:

- Knit the R markdown file “Final_Report.Rmd”. This file is located in the folder "Code". It is necessary to change the paths to your own paths.
  “Final_Report.Rmd” calls the files "Product_analysis.Rmd" and "Product_analysis_fixed.Rmd" that makes the analysis. 

- A report with all the results, named “Final_report.pdf”, is generated and put in the folder “Rcode”.

- Figures are put in the folders “Figures_main” (random effects analysis), “Figures_fixed” (fixed effects anaalysis) and “Figures_riskbias” (risk of bias analysis). Figures are numbered according to the report.

- Summary tables are put in the folders “Tables_main” and “Tables_riskbias”. Tables for the fixed effects analysis are the same as the ones for the random effects analysis and can therefore be found in "Tables_main"
